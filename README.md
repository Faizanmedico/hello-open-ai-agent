#   name = "hello-open-ai-agent"

The output Hello, Sultan! It's lovely to meet you. confirms that your Agent successfully utilized the Gemini model through the agents framework to generate the greeting.

The message OPENAI_API_KEY is not set, skipping trace export is just a warning. It indicates that tracing features (which are used for debugging and monitoring agent runs) are disabled because an OPENAI_API_KEY (which is separate from your GEMINI_API_KEY) isn't set in your environment. Since you set tracing_disabled=True in your RunConfig in connection.py, this warning is expected and doesn't affect the core functionality of your project.

# You've successfully set up:

Environment variable loading for your API key.

A connection to the Gemini API via the agents library's AsyncOpenAI client.

An OpenAIChatCompletionsModel to represent the Gemini model.

An Agent that leverages this model for its instructions.

And finally, used the Runner to execute your agent, resulting in the desired output!
